The aim of this assignment is to create a planner that given the state
of an assembly workbench can determine whether or not a target state 
is reacheable from the current state by a sequence of legal assembly actions.

The domain of the planner are objects constructed by connecting together 2D 
tetris pieces.

Here a tetris piece refers to any finite subset of occupied cells of a grid
that satisfies all the constraints listed below.
    We can associate a graph to represent a set of occupied cells.
    Each vertex of the graph corresponds to an occupied cell.
    Two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if their corresponding
    cells are adjacent (they share a cell-wall).
    
    We impose the following constraints on what we call "tetris pieces". 
    It is always the case that
        - the induced graph of the cells is connected
        - there is at least one cell in row 0 (top of the workbench)
        - there is at least one cell in column 0 (leftmost column of the grid)
        - each cell is labelled with the same integer id.
    
The tetris pieces are atomic. They cannot be split into simpler pieces.
However, we can connect them to make composite parts, and by connecting more
parts we can build complex objects.

Formally, a part is either a tetris piece or the result of moving one part
above another part and lowering the first part until it connects to the 
second part on at least one horizontal edge.

We will also consider a variation of the problem where during the assembly, 
we are also allowed to rotate a part 90 degree clockwise.

In other words, the construction process of a complex object is a 
sequence of actions.  The only allowed types of action are 
- lifting a part and dropping it onto another part
- rotating a part 90 degree clockwise (if allowed)

The state of the workbench is the set of parts present 
on the workbench.

We define a canonical order to list the parts present on a workbench.
A function is provide to put a state in this canonical order.

class TetrisPart(object):
    '''
    An instance of the class TetrisPart is 
    - either an atomic tetris piece. In this case, 'self.part_under' is None.
    - or a composite part obtained by dropping "self.part_above" onto 
      'self.part_under'
      
    *************************    WARNING   ************************* 
    If the dropped part 'part_above' does not get in contact with 'part_under'
    on at least one horizontal edge, then the resulting part is defective.
    This model the way Lego bricks connect.
    To indicate the failure, self.offset is set to None.
    
    For example dropping
        1 1
        0 1
        0 1.
    onto 
        1 0
        1 0
        1 1
    with an offset of 1 results in
        1 1
        0 1
        0 1
    not
        1  1  1 
        1  0  1 
        1  1  1 
    
    But dropping 
        1 1 1
        0 0 1
    onto
        1 0 0
        1 1 1
    with an offset of 0 results in 
        1  1  1 
        1  0  1 
        1  1  1 
             
    'self.part' is a numpy array representing the part in a canonical way;
        self.part[0] is the row in contact with the workbench
        self.part[:,0] has at least one occupied cell.
        
    The method 'self.get_frozen()' returns the 'self.part' array as a tuple of
    tuple. This is useful when a immutable representation of the part is 
    required.
    
    The method 'self.rotate90()' rotates the part in place.

    Load the workbench state stored in a the text file 'file_name'.
    Each part of the state is represented as a sequence of

    For example, a file with the contents

    represents a state with two parts.  The function returns the state
    as a tuple of tuples. For instance, with the above contents, the returned
    tuple is
    
        ( 
          ((2, 2, 2), (0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 0)),

    WARNINGS: 
        The location of the row in contact with the workbench is different 
        in the text representation and in the tuple representation.
        The file contents is similar to the output of the function
        'display_state'
        
        The state is not necessarily in canonical form.
        Use the function 'make_state_canonical' if needed.
